<h3>Objective:</h3>

The data for the study was obtained via paper-based surveys, 
including scale-based, Likert-scale, binary-response, and multiple-response items for a total of 462 participants.
The primary objective was to identify post-diagnosis dietary changes among breast cancer patients and evaluate how these trends vary by ethnicity. 
A secondary objective was to explore the way patients evaluate dietary and medical information as trust-worthy.

<h3>Data Preparation:</h3>

- Cleaned and validated data collected via paper-based surveys, removing any duplicate cases 
and correcting any erroneous imputations by the researchers. 
- Matching variables for Hebrew and Arabic surveys, and removing any irrelevant features.
- Transforming features to the correct data types (e.g., numeric, binary, etc...)
- Removing items that did not meet a pre-defined response rate

<h3>Statistical Analysis</h3>

**1. Sample Size and Power**

- During the data collection phase, calculated the needed sample size to obtain a given effect size and power level, 
taking into account multiple comparisons and p-value corrections.

**2. Descriptive and Exploratory Analysis**

- Compared demographic and clinical characteristics by ethnicity, using parametric and non-parametric tests.

**3. Comparing Dietary Preferences**

- Statistical analyses were selected based on the nature of the data: Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests for Likert-scale and non-normally distributed continuous data, 
and chi-squared tests for binary and categorical responses.
